== Overview

What is Roddy and what is it not?
- It is not a workflow.
- It is workflow development framework and you can develop, run and bundle your workflows with it.
- Roddy is designed to be as independent from the runtime environment as possible. But keep in mind, that
  this might not be the case for workflows.

Roddy has been tested and successfully used in a docker container together with Sun Grid Engine.

== Prerequisites

Roddy currently needs a JDK / JRE installed in either ~/.roddy/runtime or ~/.roddy/runtimeDevel
Roddy needs a Groovy Version of 2.3.x in the same directory like the JDK so e.g.
~/Projekte/Roddy> ll ~/.roddy/runtimeDevel/
 groovy -> groovy-2.3.6
 groovy-2.3.6
 groovy-2.4.3
 jdk -> jdk1.8.0_20
 jdk1.8.0_20
 jdk1.8.0_40
 jre -> jdk/jre

Support for Groovy 2.4.x has been tested and it is currently not working!

== Work in progress

This section contains features which are currently in development. Testable / active features
are in the changelist.
Entries here can be marked with (PLANNED) or (WIP). (TEST) is more for the Changelist.

- (PLANNED) check defined binaries for existence. Isn't this already done in the validation part?

- (PLANNED) enable and disable runFlags with --run=... and --dontrun=...

- (WIP) Roddy accepts a lot more parameters which might otherwise be configured with the
  application properties file:
    useRoddyVersion (ok), usePluginVersion,
    pluginDirectories, configurationDirectories
    commandFactoryClass,
    executionServiceClass, executionServiceAuth, executionServiceHost, executionServiceUser
  Those parameters all override the settings in the application properties file

- (WIP) Integrate slurm as a cluster backend

== Changelist

* Version update to 2.2.81

- Fix: Output directories will now always be set to type "path". This will prevent errors for
  output files, if users forget to set this particular variables to the proper type.

- (TEST) Roddy can now create auto filenames, if there was no filename pattern for a file.
  This is currently enabled by default! Auto filenames are placed in the output directory and
  contain the job name, the parameter name, the job id and the suffix .auto.

- (WIP) add the createworkflow runmode to Roddy.

- (TEST) A working and version of Roddys built in Brawl language. Brawl is be a very basic
  language to implement simple workflows. Support is e.g. given for if and a lot of typing can be skipped.
  brawl scripts will be auto converted and compiled to Groovy workflows upon startup. This way it is guaranteed
  that those scripts are written properly. Still missing is the for loop syntax.

* Version update to 2.2.69

* Version update to 2.2.66

- (TEST) Implement the "showreadme" command to show the Roddy README.md

- (TEST) Implement the "printpluginreadme" command to show the readme of a workflow.
         Also put in the "printanalysisxml" to show the analysis xml.

- (TEST) Allow selection of nodes via command line for PBS and SLURM. SGE is currently not supported.
  The configuration value to set is "enforceSubmissionToNodes:<nodeid>;<nodeid>" followed by a semicolon separated list of nodes.

- (TEST) Change output of job ids to use println.

- (TEST) Introduce a killswitch to disable filename imports upon analysis import.

* Version update to 2.2.49

- Add the --extendedlist option to support a very extended view for checkworkflostatus.
  In this view, all previous runs are shown.

- (TEST) Tool entries allow override of old entries without resetting everything.
  A ToolEntry must be defined like this: (with overrideresourcesets="true"!)
          <tool name='fastqc' value='checkFastQC.sh' basepath='qcPipeline' overrideresourcesets="true">
              <resourcesets>
                  <rset size="l" nodes="1" walltime="1000"/>
              </resourcesets>
          </tool>

- Move the configuration conversion (bash, xml) to different classes, cleansing the ConfigurationFactory a bit.

- Add the boolean configuration parameter outputAllowAccessRightsModification to allow (default) or disallow access rights modification
  on the target file system.

- queryworkflowstatus now gives a much leaner overview about all datasets of a project.
  There was also a bugfix which stated that some processes were still running though they were obviously crashed.

- The Roddy wrapper script for called scripts contains various new checks which will lead to ABORTED, if the conditions cannot be met.

- The feature toggle file can be selected with --usefeaturetoggleconfig=<file>.
  Single feature toggles can be enabled or disabled with --enabletoggle=<toggle>,<toggle> or --disabletoggle
  The list of possibly available toggle can be queried with the "showfeaturetoggles" start mode

- (TEST) Unzip of plugins is disabled by default now. Can be enabled via feature toggle. (Feature toggle id: UnzipZippedPlugins[def:false])

- (TEST) Pass parameters in a parameter file instead of the normal cli parameter passing. (Feature toggle id: ModifiedVariablePassing[def:false])

* Version update to 2.2.8

- (TEST) Break submission, if an error occurs. If a job cannot be started on a cluster environment, the overall
  job submission will be skipped. Running / Started processes are not affected. (Feature toggle id: BreakSubmissionOnError[def:false])

- (TEST) New app ini loader, does not store files. This part was remove for now.

- (TEST) XML validation will take place when XML files are loaded. (Feature toggle id: XMLValidation[def:true])

- (TEST) Roddy binaries, scripts and libraries will be stored in a different directory.
  Insided dist, there will be several bin/{version} folders like 2.1.49. Inside those, the binary and necessary
  dependencies are store like i.e.:
        dist/bin/2.1.49/Roddy.jar
                       /helperScripts
                       /lib
  Regarding Runtime libraries handling like groovy and the JDK there is no good solution yet.

* Version update to 2.1.49

- Roddy will perform a lot more checks before starting a workflow. These checks include file system
  checks, file availability and some more. 

- Roddy will delete an execution directory if no jobs were submitted. This is not working
  with the SSH library SFTP client for unknown reasons.

- The way how libraries / plugins are loaded is changed. The used plugins / version can
  be specified (descending priority):
  - A project configuration analysis import:
    <analysis id='snvCalling' configuration='snvCallingAnalysis' useplugin="COWorkflows:1.0.114,..."/>
  - On the command line with --usePluginVersion=...
  - The application ini file: usePluginVersion=COWorkflows:1.0.114,...
  Roddy will try to load plugins which are linked to the set plugins. If a plugin is missing, this
  might lead to problems.

  If the used plugins are not set, Roddy will try to load all plugins in
  their latest version.

* Version update to 2.1.28

* Version update to 2.1.27

- Bugfix: There was an error in some rare cases with the job wrapper script. In those rare
  cases, the code to query the last jobstates failed and the script was not started. This only
  occurred when using SGE. 

* Version update to 2.1.26

- Roddy tries to create all files with the proper group rights and settings. This
  is mostly tested for PBS based execution. The change of settings includes files in
  .roddyExecutionDirectory as well as those in the roddyExecutionStore
  File settings are set recursively where this is necessary.

* Version update to 2.1.24

- (TEST) You can use Roddy to create new workflows. Use the createworkflow option for that:
  bash roddy.sh createworkflow (pluginID) [native:](workflowID)

- (TEST)The application properties ini readout is changed in such a way, that the users user
  name will be used if USERNAME or "" is supplied. This will also be the default parameter.

* Version update to 2.1.14

- (TEST) There is now a basic support for native workflows. Though the workflow scripts still
  need to be adapted somehow, the new mechanism could make it very easy to integrate
  non java workflows.
  Create an analysis configuration with the following header content:
    listOfUsedTools="nativeWorkflow"
    nativeWorkflowTool="nativeWorkflow"
    targetCommandFactory="de.dkfz.roddy.execution.jobs.cluster.pbs.PBSCommandFactory"
  Do not forget to put in the workflow script!
  This is basically working, however parameters might not be passed yet and the tool is only taken
  from the job name. This might confuse people!

- Roddy now supports the parameter --useRoddyVersion= from the command line, it overrides
  the settings in the application properties ini file

* Version update to 2.1.8
