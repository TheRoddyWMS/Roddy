Roddy is a framework for development and management of script based workflows on a batch processing cluster. It has been developed at the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) in Heidelberg in the eilslabs group and is used by a number of in-house workflows such as the Pancancer Alignment Workflow and the [ACEseq workflow](https://github.com/eilslabs/ACEseqWorkflow). The development is now continued in the Omics IT and Data Management Core Facility (ODCF) at the DKFZ.
