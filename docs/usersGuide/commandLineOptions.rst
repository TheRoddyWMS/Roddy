Command line options
====================

Roddy has a wide range of run modes and options which will be explained here.
The run modes are basically divided into user options and extended developer options.
You can view all options by running Roddy without any parameters.

User options
------------

If you do not intend to develop Roddy or Roddy plugins, you can stop reading after this part.

.. admonition:: Generalized parameters since version 3.8.0

    Since version 3.8.0, Roddy's parameters -- both startup modes (``run``, ``rerun``, etc.) and options (``--useconfig``, etc.) are matched case sensitively and all "use" or "used" prefixes are removed.
    For example, ``--useconfig`` is now ``--config`` and ``--usePluginVersion`` is now ``--pluginVersion``.
    The old parameters are still supported, and the documentation here continues to refer to the old awkward parameter names.

Common additional options
-------------------------

These modes can be parametrized in various ways. Here is a summary of all options, but note that not all of them make sense in all modes.

.. list-table:: "Title"
    :Widths: 5, 20, 20

    *   - Option
        - Argument
        - Description
    *   - --useconfig
        - {file}
        - Use {file} as the application configuration.
    *   - --c
        - {file}
        - The order is: full path, .roddy folder, Roddy directory.
    *   - --verbositylevel
        - {1,3,5}
        - Set how much Roddy will print to the console, 1 is default, 3 is more, 5 is a lot.
    *   - --v
        -
        - Set verbosity to 3.
    *   - --vv
        -
        - Set verbosity to 5.
    *   - --useiodir
        - [fileIn],{fileOut}
        - Use fileIn/fileOut as the base input and output directories for your project. If fileOut is not specified, fileIn is used for that as well. The format specifier can be one of: tsv, csv or excel
    *   - --usemetadatatable
        - {file},[format]
        - Tell Roddy to use an input table to load metadata and input data and available datasets.
    *   - --waitforjobs
        -
        - Let Roddy wait for all submitted jobs to finish.
    *   - --disabletrackonlyuserjobs
        -
        - By default, Roddy will only track jobs of the current user. The switch tells Roddy to track all jobs.
    *   - --disablestrictfilechecks
        -
        - Tell Roddy to ignore missing files. By default, Roddy checks if all necessary files exist.
    *   - --ignoreconfigurationerrors
        -
        - Tell Roddy to ignore configuration errors. By default, Roddy will exit if configuration errors are detected.
    *   - --ignorecvalueduplicates
        -
        - Tell Roddy to ignore duplicate configuration values within the same configuration value block. errors. By default, Roddy will exit if duplicates are found.
    *   - --forcenativepluginconversion
        -
        - Tell Roddy to override any existing converted Native plugin. By default Roddy will prevent this.
    *   - --forcekeepexecutiondirectory
        -
        - Tell Roddy to keep execution directories. By default Roddy will delete them, if no jobs were executed in a run.
    *   - --useRoddyVersion
        - (version no)
        - Use a specific roddy version.
    *   - --rv
        - (version no)
        - Like --useRoddyVersion
    *   - --usePluginVersion
        - (...,...)
        - Supply a list of used plugins and versions.
    *   - --configurationDirectories
        - {path},...
        - Supply a list of configurationdirectories.
    *   - --pluginDirectories
        - {path},...
        - Supply a list of plugin directories.

Developer options
-----------------

A good way to compile Roddy is to use just

.. code-block:: bash

    ./gradlew build

Roddy's startup script `roddy.sh` wraps this but additionally allows for increasing the build version number (patch-number, according to `Semantic Versioning`_). Furthermore, the wrapper also simplifies the compilation of plugins for you. For these actions the following modes are available:

.. csv-table:: "Title"
    :Header: "Option", "Additional", "Description"
    :Widths: 5, 20, 20

        "compile", "", "Compiles the roddy library / application."
        "pack", "", "Creates a copy of the 'develop' version and puts the version number to the file name."
        "compileplugin", "(plugin ID) [--useconfig={file}]", "Compiles a plugin."
        "packplugin", "(plugin ID) [--useconfig={file}]", "Packages the compiled plugin in dist/plugins and creates a version number for it. Please note that you can indeed override contents of a zip file if you do not update / compile the plugin jar!"
