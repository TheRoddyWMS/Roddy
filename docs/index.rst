What is Roddy
=============

Roddy is a framework for rapid development and management of script
based workflows on a batch processing cluster. This page focuses on a
quick introduction of the framework, detailed descriptions will be
handled in their own pages.

Key Features
------------

Roddy has several key features which make it a good choice to be used as
a base for workflows:

-  Multi-Level configuration system
-  Modular application design
-  A variety of supported workflows
-  Access to several cluster backends
-  Callable stand-alone or integratable in other applications
-  Different versions of plugins/workflows and the Roddy core
   application are handled in a single installation
-  Only a few dependencies and no database for the Roddy core
   application necessary
-  Various execution modes to support users to get their work done
   faster

The multi-layer configuration system and the handling of plugin versions
make Roddy particularly well suited for multi-user, multi-project
environments.
