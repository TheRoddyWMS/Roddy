## Summary 

<!-- This should be user-focused --> 

* User requirement ID: 
* Functional requirement ID: 


## Details 

<!-- 
Describe the feature to be implemented in sufficient detail. The ultimate aim should be to make the issue S.M.A.R.T. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria).

If possible include, e.g.,

* UI sketches
* Example inputs and outputs
* Measurable limits for non-functional requirements (e.g., "X reads per second", "Use less than X MB of memory", "Use maximally X cores").
* Documentation requirements (for users, design, architecture, interfaces, etc.) 

NOTE: Keep this free of suggestions about the implementation! 
      Use section "Implementation Notes" if you want to provide implementation information.
--> 


## Notable Risks 

<!-- 
List risks that require focused implementation efforts, e.g., related to files, etc.

If necessary, suggest risk control measures, such as the implementation of runtime-assertions, deep verification/testing (e.g., minimal new-code test coverage), etc.
--> 


## Validations

<!--
What needs to be tested during validation of the new change?

Note that "validation" refers to the proof that the software as implemented meets the intended use of the software. This means, validations prove that (1) the user and functional requirements and that (2) all the unspecified (but implemented!) behaviors are suitable for the purpose.

Examples could be:

* "Demonstrate UI to stakeholders X and Y, and get their approval." 
* "Test interaction of changed system with other system X."

NOTE: All validations need to be documented in the merge request for the issue.

## Important Stakeholders 

<!-- 
List expert stakeholders to contact in case of questions.

Without this information, it may be impossible to refine the requirements to a level, that the issue can actually be made S.M.A.R.T.!
-->

## Implementation Notes (optional)

<!--
Put here all information related to the actual implementation, such as important information about the codebase, dependencies, etc., and suggestions for the implementation.
